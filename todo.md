## Event Dispatching

## verify import/require modules are not webpack duplicates
    some of the packages if imported differently become a different webpack require component = redundant code.

## Templating server/client

### Main app / entry point

### Component test instance/example

### AMD style loading/ selective library loading of content.

### Unit testing (tape/tap)

### Hot loading (react hot loading is sweet?)

### Update deploy script
    all files should be minified and compiled into the /dist/ folder

### NPM post install script
    setup a local server configuration file (server.localconfig.js should be a local file that is ignored by the repo.)
